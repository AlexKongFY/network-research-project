Created an automated solution for anonymous access to remote machines via onion routing networks. Conducted target reconnaissance and gathered system information, with network traffic monitoring through a sniffer application. Employed technologies such as nipe, Torify, Whois, Nmap, Wireshark, SSHpass, TCPdump along with Bash scripting. It also performs software checks for the needed remote control script and self-installed the necessary components.
